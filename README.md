Final Demo Walkthrough
The Dynamic Image Slider project demonstrates an interactive front-end web component where users can view images that automatically transition with animations.

Features include:

Automatic sliding at defined intervals.

Manual navigation using previous/next buttons.

Responsive layout for all screen sizes.

Smooth transition effects (fade/slide animations).

Captions or indicators for each image.

Demo process:

Open index.html in a web browser.

Observe the image slider start automatically.

Use navigation arrows or dots to switch slides manually.

The slider pauses on hover and resumes on mouse leave.

The demo shows how front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are integrated to produce a visually appealing and responsive image gallery.
