# Dynamic-Image-Slider
The Dynamic Image Slider is a front-end web development project designed to create an engaging and interactive way to showcase multiple images within a single section of a webpage. The slider allows images to transition smoothly, either automatically after a specific time interval or manually through navigation buttons.
